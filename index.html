      <h1>An Introduction to CSS/SASS</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! This page is designed to introduce a few stylish organizational ideas to make working with CSS and SASS a little more <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif" >awesome</a>.
        It also is a living reference guide and exercise for proper CSS and SASS techniques.
        Currently, there are two versions of this page: one filled with numerous CSS anti-patterns, and one that is better organized and conforms to our architecture and style.
        As an exercise/tutorial, this page is meant to be cleaned-up and tweaked to be more semantic and badass.
        Careful inspectors of the markup and CSS will notice a few glaring patterns evident in this version.
        We've got a lack of classes, we're globally changing elements, and ultimately have set up a teetering tower ready to crumble into a million tear-soaked pieces.

      <h2>The Role of CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Most everyone knows that CSS is used for styling content.  Any given web page can be separated in to three (not <em>exactly</em> disctinct) categories: (1) Content, (2) Decoration, (3) Interactivity.  As you've probably guessed, the content is usually just HTML, the decoration is CSS, and the interactivity is the page's JavaScript.  Today we'll talk about a page's "decoration" layer.

      <h2>Selection</h2>
      <p>
        The most fundamental concept in CSS is selection.  We've all used CSS selectors before.  We've seen that <code>*</code>, the <code>.something</code> or the <code>#hashtag</code>.  These commonly used selectors are usually called <span class="bold">simple selectors</span>.  CSS gets fun (or ugly) when we chain these simple selectors together.
      </p>

      <div class="well">
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        A CSS <span class="bold">combinator</span> combines or explains the relationship between two or more simple selectors.
      </div>
